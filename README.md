A playground for Jasmine using a web example found at:
	https://dev.to/aurelkurtula/unit-testing-with-jasmine-the-very-basics-74k

Changed to fix a bunch of errors found in the post.

Yo Kayt:

Start with commit "First simple tests" and then walk through each commit from there
one at a time.

Note the beauty of "I am Programmer God" commit, as it busts the hell out of the
tests -- as a "Programmer God" can (and should) do as befits his/her mood (swing).

:)
